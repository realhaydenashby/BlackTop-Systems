Rewrite the entire BlackTop Systems codebase around one core architecture: a financial diagnostic engine. Strip away everything that is not essential to delivering the founder-facing MVP. Keep the design simple, minimal, fast, and stable.

⸻

GOAL

Rebuild BlackTop so it does ONLY these things:
	1.	Connect to financial sources
	•	Yodlee/Plaid (bank)
	•	QuickBooks/Xero (accounting)
	•	Stripe (revenue)
	2.	Ingest all transactions
	•	Pull debits and credits
	•	Store them in a unified table
	3.	Normalize the data using Groq + Gemini
	•	Vendor normalization
	•	Category classification
	•	Recurring spend detection
	•	Payroll vs non-payroll
	•	Revenue vs expense
	4.	Compute core analytics
	•	Burn rate
	•	Runway
	•	Cash flow
	•	Base-case forecast
	5.	Generate a small set of actionable insights
	•	3–5 AI-generated recommendations
	•	Anomaly detection
	•	Subscription creep
	•	Vendor spikes
	•	Payroll drift
	6.	Deliver the results in two places
	•	Inside the web dashboard
	•	Slack/SMS notifications (Ramp-style alerts)
	7.	Keep everything minimal and founder-friendly
	•	No overbuilt FP&A
	•	No unnecessary pages
	•	No experimental modules
	•	No bright colors or clutter

ACTIONS TO TAKE ON THE CODEBASE

1. Remove everything unrelated to the diagnostic engine

Delete or consolidate: 
Dashboard, Transactions, Documents, Analytics Suite, Fundraising Prep Suite, Budgets, Action Plans
	•	Unused components
	•	Unused pages
	•	Placeholder analytics
	•	Overbuilt charts
	•	Anything not tied to ingestion → normalization → analytics → insights

2. Rebuild the folder structure EXACTLY like this

/server
  /integrations       (yodlee, plaid, qb, xero, stripe)
  /ingestion          (raw transaction ingestion handlers)
  /normalize          (vendor/category classifiers using Groq + Gemini)
  /analytics          (burn, runway, cashflow, forecasting)
  /insights           (action plans + anomalies)
  /notifs             (slack + sms alerts)

/client
  /dashboard          (spend, revenue, burn, runway, forecast)
  /auth
  /components
  /layout

3. Implement one unified transaction object

{
  id,
  date,
  description,
  vendor_normalized,
  category,
  amount,
  type: "debit" | "credit",
  is_recurring,
  source: "bank" | "stripe" | "qb" | "xero"
}

4. Add ONLY these analytics functions
	•	calculateBurnRate()
	•	calculateRunway()
	•	calculateCashFlow()
	•	generateForecastBaseCase()

5. Build the insights engine

It should output 3–5 actionable insights per dataset, such as:
	•	“AWS spend up 42% this week.”
	•	“Payroll drift exceeded plan by 9%.”
	•	“Recurring SaaS spend is $3,450. Suggested reduction: $900–$1,400.”
	•	“You have 6.2 months of runway remaining.”

Insights must appear on every page.

6. Implement Slack + SMS notifications (this is later)

Trigger alerts when:
	•	A vendor spikes
	•	Burn accelerates
	•	Runway shortens
	•	Subscriptions balloon
	•	A spending anomaly occurs

Make notifications clean, simple, and short. Users must also be able to respond to the text/slack and upload it receipts or things like that

7. Rebuild the UI to match a minimal, grayscale, modern design
	•	Simple typography
	•	Clear spacing
	•	One “Action Plan” block at the bottom of every analytics page

Pages needed:
	•	Dashboard and individual dropdown (Spend(overall and by category), Revenue, Burn, Runway, Forecast, Raise, Hiring)
	•	Transactions + Modeling page with spreadsheet layout and all financial information for manual forecasting
	•	Connect Accounts
	•	Settings
	•	ONLY what’s required for the engine to operate

⸻

EXPECTED OUTPUT

A simplified, stable, and scalable codebase that:
	•	Works end-to-end
	•	Is easy to extend into a full modeling product later
	•	Can be demoed confidently
	•	Mirrors the simplicity of Ramp + the intelligence of Parallel
	•	Has the backbone needed for future FP&A expansion

This rebuild should make BlackTop:

“Connect → ingest → understand → explain → alert → decide.”

That is the entire product.
