Perfect! Here's exactly what to reply to get Replit Agent on track:

Great questions! Here are my answers:

**1. Tech Stack: Option A - Keep TypeScript/Node.js/Express**
Stick with what's already built. Don't rewrite anything. Just add Yodlee and Groq on top of the existing backend.

**2. Demo Mode Routing: Option B - Keep existing pages at root level**
Don't move anything. Current dashboard at `/dashboard` stays exactly as-is for demo users. We'll build NEW pages at `/app/*` for live mode. Zero changes to existing routes.

**3. Authentication: Option C - Use existing auth, add user flag**
Keep Replit Auth. Add a boolean field `is_live_mode` to the users table. Demo users have `is_live_mode = false`, live users have `is_live_mode = true`. That's it.

**4. Yodlee Environment: Sandbox for now**
Yes, sandbox. The credentials I provided are for Yodlee Sandbox. We'll test with their sandbox banks first.

**5. Scope: Build incrementally, ONE feature at a time**
This is critical: **Do NOT build all 6 pages at once.**

Here's the order I want:

**Phase 1: Bank Connection ONLY (this week)**
- Create `/app/connect` page (onboarding flow)
- Backend endpoints for Yodlee FastLink
- Store transactions in database
- **Stop here and let me test before moving forward**

**Phase 2: Classification (next week)**
- Groq vendor normalization
- Groq category classification  
- Recurring detection
- **Stop here and let me test**

**Phase 3: Transactions Page (week 3)**
- Build `/app/transactions` page
- Show classified transactions
- Manual override UI
- **Stop here and let me test**

**Phase 4-6: Other pages (only after Phase 3 works)**
- Performance page
- Runway page
- Snapshot page

**Important rules:**
- ❌ Don't touch ANY existing code in `/dashboard`, `/transactions`, `/documents`, etc.
- ❌ Don't modify existing database tables (users, transactions if they exist)
- ✅ Create NEW files only: `/app/*` routes, new API endpoints, new components
- ✅ Show me code BEFORE running migrations or making database changes
- ✅ Build small, test, then build next feature

**Start with Phase 1 only:** Show me your plan for JUST the Yodlee bank connection. What files will you create? What endpoints? What database tables?

This should get Replit Agent focused on:
1. Not touching existing code
2. Building incrementally 
3. Starting with ONLY bank connection
4. Asking for approval before proceeding

The key phrase is **"Stop here and let me test before moving forward"** - that forces it to pause between phases.
