Replace the current pricing section (Starter / Team Pro / SMB Intelligence as it exists now) with a clean, conversion-ready pricing layout using the tiers below.

	•	Descriptions

	•	Prices
	•	“Most popular” badge

====================================================

(choose one consistent with the rest of the site; if a demo/contact flow exists, link to it)

⸻

	4.	Fundraise-Ready Add-On

⸻

This is an add-on, not a standalone plan. Present it visually below the main plans or as a side card clearly labeled “Add-on.” It should be attachable to any tier.
	•	Label: Fundraise-Ready Add-On
	•	Price: Either:
	•	“+$49 one-time” or
	•	“+$19/month”
(You can show both options as toggle or just list them together in the description.)

	•	Feature bullets:
	•	Investor metrics dashboard (burn, runway, raise needs)
	•	“How much should we raise?” scenario model
	•	AI-generated investor prep packet (summary + charts)
	•	Basic pitch review using your financials
	•	Note line (small text): “Can be added to any plan.”

====================================================
LAYOUT & UX RULES
	1.	Use a clear three-column layout for the main plans:
	•	Column 1: Founder Lite
	•	Column 2: Startup Clarity (Most Popular, visually emphasized)
	•	Column 3: SMB Intelligence
	2.	Place the Fundraise-Ready Add-On:
	•	Either below the three main plans as a wide card
	•	Or as a distinct side panel clearly labeled “Add-On”
	3.	Maintain:
	•	Plan names
	•	Price in large font
	•	Tagline in smaller font under the plan name
	•	Feature bullets as a clean list
	•	Single primary CTA button per plan
	4.	No placeholder text like “Click to see full details →”.
If there is a details page or modal, keep the link but adjust copy to something like “View plan details”.

====================================================
COPY TONE & CONSISTENCY
	•	Avoid jargon like “next-gen”, “synergy”, “smart AI layer”.
	•	Emphasize outcomes:
	•	Know your burn and runway.
	•	See where money is going.
	•	Decide what to cut or double down on.
	•	Show up prepared for investors.
	•	Ensure all copy is consistent with the actual product:
	•	Ingest → normalize → diagnostics → budget → action plan → (optional fundraise prep)

====================================================
MOBILE RESPONSIVENESS
	•	On mobile:
	•	Stack plans vertically in this order:
	1.	Startup Clarity (Most Popular)
	2.	Founder Lite
	3.	SMB Intelligence
	•	Add-on can appear after all three.
	•	Ensure spacing, font sizes, and buttons stay clean and tappable.

====================================================
FINAL REQUIREMENTS
	•	Remove the old “Starter / Team Pro / SMB Intelligence” content and any “Product A / Services” style leftover copy.
	•	Replace with the exact four offerings above.
	•	Keep styling consistent with the existing BlackTop Systems theme.
	•	Do not break existing nav, footer, or routing.

You are producing a real, investor-ready pricing page that clearly sells BlackTop Systems to:
	•	solo founders,
	•	growing startups,
	•	and SMBs,
with a fundraise-focused add-on.
