You are updating an existing B2B SaaS application into a polished, production-style platform.

The product is now called BlackTop Systems. Apply this name, logo placeholder, and theme consistently across:
	•	Public marketing pages
	•	Auth screens
	•	App shell (sidebar, top bar, footer)
	•	Dashboards and analytics pages
	•	PDFs/exports (if any)

Do NOT delete or break any existing functionality.
Do NOT remove existing routes, models, or components that already work.
Extend everything non-destructively.

====================================================
PRODUCT SUMMARY

BlackTop Systems is a financial diagnostics + action platform for SMBs and startups.

	4.	Generate budgets and action plans that operators can execute without a full finance team.
