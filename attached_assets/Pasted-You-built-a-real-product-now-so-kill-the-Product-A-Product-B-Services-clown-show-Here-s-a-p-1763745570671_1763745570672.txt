You built a real product now, so kill the “Product A / Product B / Services” clown show.

Here’s a prompt you can paste into Replit / your AI builder to rewrite the Products page into something that actually matches BlackTop:

⸻

You are updating the Products / Features page for a B2B SaaS app called BlackTop Systems.

Context

Current page content (messy and redundant):

Analytics that actually matter
Stop guessing. Start knowing. Our AI diagnoses your spend and shows you what changed and why.

Product A
Track spending across software, marketing, operations, and more.
Product B
See which teams are spending what—and where to optimize.
Product C
Identify monthly commitments draining your runway.
Services
Catch forgotten SaaS tools costing you thousands.
Product A
Spot when campaigns exceed budget before it’s too late.
Product B
Monitor unexpected spikes in labor costs.
Product C
AI flags suspicious charges and duplicate invoices.
Services
Detect unusual spending patterns before they become problems.
Product A
Compare QoQ performance with detailed period analysis.
Product B
AI explains every variance with context and recommendations.

Delete all of that and replace it with a clean, structured Products / What We Do page that accurately reflects BlackTop’s real product.

1. Product Positioning

Use this positioning clearly at the top:

Headline:
BlackTop Systems: The AI Finance Copilot for Startups & SMBs

Subheadline:
Ingest your financial chaos, see your real burn and runway, and get a budget + action plan you can actually execute.

⸻

2. Page Structure

Rebuild the Products page into 3 main sections, no “Product A/B/C” nonsense:

Section 1: Ingest & Normalize

Explain that BlackTop:
	•	Connects to bank / card feeds (via Plaid/Yodlee or file uploads)
	•	Ingests PDFs, CSVs, invoices, receipts, subscription emails
	•	Normalizes everything into clean transactions with:
	•	vendor
	•	category
	•	department
	•	recurring vs one-time
	•	tags/subscriptions

Add a short feature list, for example:
	•	“Bank, card, and document ingestion in one place”
	•	“Automatic vendor and category classification”
	•	“Subscription and duplicate spend detection”

Keep copy concise, professional, and concrete.

Section 2: Diagnose What’s Really Happening

This is the analytics layer. Show the core things BlackTop does, not generic “analytics”:

Split into two subsections:
	1.	For startups preparing to fundraise:

	•	Burn rate analytics (payroll vs non-payroll)
	•	Runway estimates under multiple scenarios
	•	Raise planning (“how much should we raise?”)
	•	Headcount / hiring planning impact on runway

	2.	For SMBs:

	•	Spend by category, department, and vendor
	•	Subscription creep and vendor overbilling
	•	Month-over-month and quarter-over-quarter trends
	•	Cash flow trends and early runway warnings

Make it clear this is decision-support, not just pretty charts.

Section 3: Plan & Act (Budgets + Action Plans)

This is your wedge. Spell it out:
	•	AI-generated budget based on actual historical spend
	•	Department-level allocations & vendor caps
	•	Runway impact of different budget choices
	•	Monthly Action Plan:
	•	“Cut these subscriptions”
	•	“Cap this campaign at $X”
	•	“This vendor drifted +22% vs last quarter”
	•	“These changes extend runway by Y months”

Include a visual description like “Budget + Action Plan” cards instead of random “Services” blocks.

⸻

3. Design & Copy Requirements
	•	No placeholder labels like “Product A / Product B / Services.”
	•	Use clear, descriptive section titles:
	•	“Ingest & Normalize”
	•	“Diagnose Your Spend”
	•	“Budgets & Action Plans”
	•	Tone: clear, confident, practical. No buzzword salad.
	•	Keep paragraphs short, with supporting bullet lists.
	•	Match the dark, modern BlackTop theme (navy / gray / blue / teal) but don’t change layout structure beyond this page.

⸻

4. Tie Back To Outcomes

At the bottom of the page, add a short “Why teams use BlackTop” band with 3 outcome tiles, such as:
	•	“Know your real burn & runway in minutes”
	•	“Show up to investors with clean, defensible numbers”
	•	“Extend runway without guessing where to cut”

Make sure all text aligns with what the app actually does:
Ingest → Normalize → Analyze → Budget → Action Plan.

⸻

Apply all of this to the existing Products page, replacing the messy content with a focused, product-accurate, startup- and SMB-ready description of BlackTop.
