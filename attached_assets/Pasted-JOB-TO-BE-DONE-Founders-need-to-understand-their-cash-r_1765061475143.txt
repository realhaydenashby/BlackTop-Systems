JOB TO BE DONE

Founders need to understand their cash reality and what to do next month, without building a financial model, without talking to sales, and in under 5 minutes.

They don’t want:
	•	templates
	•	dashboards
	•	spreadsheets
	•	FP&A theory

They want:
	•	clarity
	•	direction
	•	fast

Parallel = board-ready modeling
BlackTop = operator-ready decisions

CORE JOB STATEMENT

“Give me my financial truth, tell me what changed, why it matters, and what to do about it — without me modeling anything.”

⸻

PAINS
	1.	Setup & modeling is slow and cognitively heavy
Even with Parallel, you spend hours getting a trustworthy model.
	2.	Pricing & sales friction
Opaque pricing and demos deter experimentation.
	3.	Classic SaaS bias
Non-SaaS models (e-commerce, agencies, healthcare, hardware) feel manual.
	4.	Wrappers are a trap
Most “AI finance” tools are just text wrappers over data. Fragile, ephemeral, easy to copy.
	5.	Founders don’t know which inputs matter
They don’t know what to type into templates.

⸻

DESIRED OUTCOME

“I log in, my finances are already modeled, the system tells me what’s wrong, gives me 3 actions, and I either approve them or ignore them.”

⸻

POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS (AT A HIGH LEVEL)

1) Auto-ingestion → baseline model
	•	Connect bank, payroll, invoices, subscriptions
	•	Build the model automatically from source systems
	•	Ask only for deltas (yes/no approvals)

“No setup. Just connect.”

⸻

2) Model validation & auto-correction

Flag unrealistic assumptions:
	•	ad spend ramp
	•	payroll drift
	•	CAC rising
	•	seasonality

System says:

“These numbers don’t make sense. Here’s why. Approve correction?”

⸻

3) Unit economics as default

For non-SaaS:
	•	contribution margin per unit/order
	•	inventory cycle
	•	capex
	•	working capital
	•	payback period

Dashboard starts with:
	•	gross margin per unit
	•	cash cycle
	•	payback
	•	contribution margin

Not MRR.

⸻

4) Vertical wedge (one, not many)

Pick one to dominate:
	•	e-commerce
or
	•	agencies
or
	•	home services
or
	•	healthcare
or
	•	MSPs

Each gets:
	•	language
	•	templates
	•	KPI defaults
	•	workflows
	•	examples

Founders think:

“This was built for me, not my board.”

⸻

5) Initiative, not queries

Platform interrupts founder with truth:
	•	“Payroll is up 18%”
	•	“AWS cost +23%, here’s likely causes”
	•	“Marketing slipped +22%, here’s impact”
	•	“Your payback period extended by 45 days”

Wrappers wait for questions.
Platforms generate questions.

Initiative = moat.

⸻

6) Touch money, not just charts

Long-term:
	•	ACH
	•	payroll
	•	vendor payments
	•	budget caps
	•	card controls
	•	renewal/negotiation flow

Wrappers summarize.
Platforms execute.

If you own spend, you’re unkillable.

⸻

HOW MIGHT WE ACCOMPLISH THIS?

a) Model-from-data engine

Ingest → Normalize → Model → Validate → Ask for approvals

Work:
	•	parse PDFs
	•	bank statements
	•	APIs
	•	email forwarding
	•	category mapping
	•	vendor knowledge graph

Output:
	•	baseline model
	•	flagged assumptions
	•	3–5 recommended actions

⸻

b) 5-minute “holy crap” moment

Requirement:

Solo founder should get 1 number they didn’t know before — in minutes — without talking to a person.

Examples:
	•	actual runway vs assumed
	•	inventory cash cycle
	•	payroll drift
	•	top vendor cost increase

That is the moment that sells.

⸻

c) Persistent financial fingerprint

Maintain state:
	•	vendors
	•	seasonality
	•	payback
	•	debt schedule
	•	margins
	•	working capital
	•	churn

Wrappers are stateless.
Platforms remember.

⸻

d) Workflows, not UI

You’re not a prettier spreadsheet.
You are a system of behavior:
	•	budgets issued
	•	vendor caps created
	•	hiring guardrails
	•	alerts on drift
	•	suggested cuts
	•	renewal reminders

Users act inside the system.

That creates lock-in.

⸻

e) Vertical-first GTM

Pick a segment where:
	•	CAC obvious
	•	contribution margin matters
	•	working capital is pain

E-commerce is perfect.

You solve:
	•	traffic → conversion → AOV
	•	returns
	•	shipping
	•	inventory
	•	lead times
	•	margin erosion
	•	payback

No SaaS competitor touches this fluently.

JTBD SUMMARY

Job to be done

Know what’s happening financially and what to do next, instantly, without models.

Possible solutions
	•	auto-ingested baseline model
	•	model validation & correction
	•	unit economics dashboards
	•	5-minute insight moment
	•	vertical-first

How might we accomplish
	•	ingest → normalize → model → validate → approve
	•	persistent fingerprint
	•	workflows & decisions
	•	eventually touch spend

⸻

STRATEGIC LINE

Parallel = board decks
BlackTop = operator truth

Parallel = FP&A
BlackTop = Operating finance

Parallel asks you to model
BlackTop models for you

Parallel answers when asked
BlackTop tells you before you ask

⸻

LITMUS TEST FOR NOT BEING A WRAPPER

If founders say:

“It told me what was happening before I even asked.”

You win.

If they say:

“I asked it questions and it summarized stuff.”

You’re a wrapper.

⸻

FINISH LINE

Remove the concept of modeling entirely.
Be the place where messy financial reality becomes structured decisions.
Deliver direction in under 5 minutes.

That’s the product. That’s the wedge.
