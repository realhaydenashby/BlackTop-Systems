Refactor the entire BlackTop Systems platform into a next-generation financial modeling and intelligence environment that combines the simplicity and speed of BlackTop with the modeling depth of Parallel. Preserve our minimal founder-first UX, but add a full modeling workspace that functions like an AI-accelerated Excel for startups. The platform must allow founders to get live insights in 30 minutes, then go deep if they want—without requiring complex onboarding.”

Do all of the following:

====================================================
	1.	CORE REBUILD: ADD THE ‘AI MODELING WORKBOOK’
====================================================

Create a new feature called Modeling Workbook, which functions like a simplified spreadsheet inside the app:
	•	Sheets for:
• Financial Model
• Revenue Model
• Hiring Plan
• CAC/LTV
• Operating Expenses
• Scenario Engine
	•	AI auto-generates the full model from:
• QuickBooks/Xero data
• Stripe revenue
• Bank feeds
• Payroll data
• Historical transactions
	•	Users can override or edit any line item, similar to Excel.
	•	But AI maintains formulas, sanity checks, and consistency.

No manual model setup.
AI builds the entire model first.

====================================================
2. CLEAN UX REWRITE (KEEP OUR SIMPLICITY)

Redesign the app so that BlackTop has two modes:

Mode A: Founder Mode (Default)
	•	30-minute setup
	•	Simple dashboards
	•	Action plans
	•	Runway
	•	Raise recommendations
	•	Cash insights
	•	“What changed this month?”
	•	Visual charts only, no complexity
	•	Zero finance background needed
	•	Instant intelligence

Mode B: Analyst Mode (Advanced)
	•	Opens the AI Modeling Workbook
	•	Editable assumptions
	•	Deep scenario modeling
	•	Department-level budgets
	•	Multi-driver forecasts
	•	Editable revenue logic
	•	Hiring plan tool
	•	All formulas are AI-maintained

Parallel’s depth with Notion/Ramp-level simplicity.

====================================================
3. REMODEL ALL ANALYTICS PAGES FOR EXPECTED DEPTH

For each analytics category (Spend, Revenue, Profitability, Forecasting):
	•	Add deeper charts, CFO-level KPIs, and scenario toggles
	•	Add a “View in Modeling Workbook” button
	•	Include action plan summaries on every page
	•	Replace placeholder data with consistent demo datasets
	•	Use a professional dark navy theme
	•	Smooth transitions, clean typography, no clutter
	•	Use consistent, elegant color palettes

====================================================
4. ADD THESE CORE MODULES (MATCH / SURPASS PARALLEL)

A. Live Financial Model
	•	Pulls from QBO/Xero/Stripe/Bank
	•	Updates in real time
	•	AI diagnoses mistakes or missing assumptions

B. Hiring Plan + Runway Tool
	•	Add/remove hires
	•	Fully-loaded cost adjustments
	•	AI recommends safe hiring ranges
	•	Real-time runway changes

C. Raise Planning Tool
	•	Auto-calculates “how much to raise”
	•	Shows milestones
	•	Models runway post-raise
	•	Creates investor-facing narrative

D. Scenario Engine
	•	Best case / base case / conservative
	•	Revenue drivers
	•	Spend cuts
	•	CAC/LTV shifts
	•	Headcount growth
	•	Seasonality

E. Board-Ready Snapshot
	•	Generate a PDF with:
• Burn
• Runway
• Highlights
• Lowlights
• Forecast
• Key risks
• Action plan

====================================================
5. MAINTAIN OUR ADVANTAGE: ZERO OVERHEAD

Ensure the entire platform is “Parallel without pain”:
	•	No 6-hour onboarding
	•	No manual model build
	•	AI does 95% of the setup
	•	User only reviews/challenges assumptions
	•	Ensure all integrations work:
• QuickBooks
• Xero
• Puzzle
• Stripe
• Plaid/Yodlee
• Gmail invoice parsing
• Groq/Gemini intelligence
• Google Doc AI for PDFs

====================================================
6. OVERRIDE ANY COMPLEXITY WITH AI GUARDRAILS

Build guardrails so users cannot “break” the model:
	•	AI protects formulas
	•	AI corrects broken assumptions
	•	AI flags unrealistic inputs
	•	AI auto-reconciles model vs real data

====================================================
7. RETAIN OUR CORE IDENTITY

BlackTop must stay:
	•	Beautiful
	•	Founder-friendly
	•	Fast
	•	Minimalist
	•	Useful on Day 1
	•	Ready for fundraising
	•	Better UX than Ramp, Parallel, or QuickBooks

Visual consistency:
Dark navy, charcoal, deep blue accents, clean cards, smooth transitions.

====================================================
8. FINAL DELIVERABLE

Produce a working version of BlackTop that functions as:

A modern, AI-native, founder-first replacement for Parallel
with an embedded FP&A modeling engine anyone can use in 30 minutes.”
