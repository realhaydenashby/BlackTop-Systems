BLACKTOP SYSTEMS
Full Product + Strategy Document (Cleaned, Structured, Complete)
————————————————————————

1. One-Sentence Definition

BlackTop Systems is the AI financial copilot for SMBs and startups that converts messy financial inputs into clean insights, a smart budget, and a simple monthly action plan — without needing a CFO.

You are not accounting.
You are not FP&A lite.
You are the pre-accounting / pre-FP&A intelligence layer.

————————————————————————

2. Problem

SMBs operate financially blind because their data is scattered across:
	•	Bank statements
	•	Invoices
	•	Subscription emails
	•	Payroll reports
	•	Receipts
	•	Ad dashboards
	•	Random spreadsheets

They only learn the truth:
	•	At month-end
	•	When cash runs low
	•	Or when the accountant calls

The real pain:
Founders cannot answer “What should we spend next month — and why?”
No tool gives them clarity + direction from raw inputs.

————————————————————————

3. Solution (What BlackTop Does)

BlackTop performs three core functions:

3.1 Ingestion & Normalization

Transforms chaotic inputs into structured data:
	•	PDFs → extracted transactions
	•	Invoices → vendor mapping
	•	Emails → recurring spend detection
	•	Bank statements → categorized entries
	•	Receipts → expense tagging
	•	CSVs → standardized fields

All unified into one clean schema.

3.2 Diagnostics (The Financial MRI)

Automatically identifies:
	•	Category & department spend
	•	Recurring vendor burn
	•	Subscription creep
	•	Vendor overbilling
	•	Payroll overtime drift
	•	Trend anomalies
	•	Month-over-month & QoQ changes
	•	“Here’s what changed and why” analysis

3.3 Budget Builder + Action Plan

The true wedge.

Budget Builder outputs:
	•	Recommended monthly budget
	•	Dept-level allocations
	•	Vendor-level caps
	•	+10% / –10% scenario budgets
	•	Cash runway projections

Action Plan outputs:
	•	“Cut these duplicate subscriptions”
	•	“These 3 vendors exceeded industry benchmarks”
	•	“Marketing drift is +22%; here’s why”
	•	“Overtime added $3,100; adjust schedules”

Playbooks (Resources):
	•	Reduce software burn
	•	Build a real marketing budget
	•	Run a vendor audit in 30 minutes
	•	90-day cash forecasting
	•	Improve gross margin
	•	Startup budget templates

You deliver clarity + direction, not compliance.

————————————————————————

5. Target Customer (ICP)

SMBs and startups with 0–75 employees:
	•	Agencies
	•	E-commerce brands
	•	Construction
	•	Real estate operators
	•	Boutiques / small manufacturers
	•	Service companies
	•	Early startups

Traits:
	•	Messy inputs
	•	No finance team
	•	Cannot interpret financials
	•	Want clarity and direction
	•	Hate spreadsheets

This is a segment Ramp/Brex ignore.

————————————————————————

6. Competitive Landscape & Positioning

Where everyone else sits:

Accounting (QBO/Xero): Compliance and bookkeeping — assume clean data.
FP&A (Mosaic, Pry, Jirav): Structured data → models — require a finance person.
Spend management (Ramp/Brex): Control spend — only see spend through their rails.
AI bookkeeping (Vic.ai, Kick): AP automation — focused on accounting workflows.
Bench/Pilot: Service-heavy bookkeeping + tax.

Your whitespace:

Messy inputs → clarity → budget → action plan.
No one else is doing this for tiny companies as a product.

————————————————————————

7. Competitive Advantages (Moats)

Real moats you can actually build:
	1.	Data normalization across unstructured sources
	2.	Budget + action plan engine (no competitor offers this)
	3.	Cross-source intelligence (bank + docs + email + CRM)
	4.	Vendor knowledge graph
	5.	Company-specific financial fingerprints
	6.	Workflow lock-in
If decisions are made inside BlackTop, the product becomes sticky.

————————————————————————

8. TAM / SAM / SOM (U.S. Only)

Assumptions:
	•	6.2M employer SMBs
	•	Exclude >75 employees → 4.7M SMBs
	•	~70% have no CFO → 3.3M pre-finance SMBs
	•	Expected adoption for financial intelligence tools: 3–6%

TAM
4.7M × $1,000 ACV
→ $4.7B

SAM
Tech-forward 25% of those SMBs:
1.17M × $1,000
→ $1.17B

SOM (5-year realistic)
1–2% penetration of SAM:
11,700–23,400 customers
→ $12M–$24M

The market is real, large, and underserved.

————————————————————————

9. Pricing Strategy

Launch Pricing
	•	$49/mo — Solo founder
	•	$129/mo — Small team (3 seats)
	•	$249/mo — SMB (10 seats + forecasting)

Add-ons
	•	Forecasting module: $29–$49/mo
	•	Multi-entity: $19/entity
	•	Insight Packs (AI-generated reports): $9/report
	•	Additional seats: $12/seat

Later (Enterprise)
	•	$500–$1,200/mo
	•	SSO, audit logs, multi-entity, SLAs

Pricing logic:
Must be cheap enough for founders to impulse-buy, but serious enough to justify handling financial data.

————————————————————————

10. Go-To-Market Strategy

Recommended Initial Motion: Direct-to-SMB/Startup

Because:
	•	They feel the pain
	•	Fast adoption cycles
	•	Easy credit card swipe
	•	No CFO friction
	•	Demo mode makes virality easy

Secondary Channel (Later): Fractional CFOs

Let them use BlackTop with their clients for distribution scale.

	•	Bank statement PDF → parser
	•	CSV ingestion pipeline
	•	Invoice/receipt image OCR (Google / Gemini / Groq)

Outputs:
	•	Monthly budget
	•	Department allocations
	•	Vendor caps
	•	Runway estimate
	•	±10% scenarios

E. Action Plan Generator

Outputs:
	•	Top cuts
	•	Waste areas
	•	Spending drifts
	•	Subscription creep
	•	Vendor renegotiation opportunities
	•	“Do this in order” list

F. SaaS Infrastructure
	•	Stripe billing
	•	Auth0 (roles, MFA, API protection)
	•	Multi-tenant org structure
	•	Role-based access

G. Frontend / UX

Theme: dark, navy, teal, minimalist, Space Grotesk
Pages needed:
	•	Home
	•	Features
	•	Resources
	•	Pricing
	•	App onboarding flow
	•	Dashboard
	•	Budget Builder
	•	Action Plan page
	•	Demo Mode

H. CRM Integration (Post-MVP)

Only need:
	•	Client names
	•	Revenue per client
	•	Closed/won dates
	•	Project mapping


You already have:
	•	Pricing page, resources page, home, login
	•	Templates with metrics/perf dashboard
	•	Stripe wired
	•	Google + Groq wired
	•	Need Plaid

So stack-wise you’re in decent shape. You don’t need “more APIs” just to collect logos. You need a minimal, end-to-end flow that proves:

Ingest docs + connect bank + read email → normalize → analytics → budget → action plan


1. Core APIs You Actually Need

1. Plaid (non-negotiable)

Purpose: bank data ingestion.

You use it for:
	•	Pulling transactions (last 3–6 months)
	•	Pulling balances
	•	Maybe account metadata

That alone + your docs upload gives you plenty of signal.

Do NOT also add Yodlee / MX / whatever right now. One aggregator is enough.

⸻

2. Stripe (you already have it)

Purpose: subscription & billing.

That’s enough for monetization. You do not need Stripe Issuing, Treasury, etc. You’re not Ramp.

Just make sure:
	•	Plans & webhooks are wired
	•	Org plan_tier actually updates in your DB

⸻

3. Google (Document AI / Drive / OAuth)

You already have Google & Groq; the minimum useful combo is:
	•	Google Document AI (or equivalent) for:
	•	OCR on PDFs (statements, invoices, receipts)
	•	Basic field / table extraction

That gives you:
	•	Non-bank docs → structured text → your transaction schema.

You don’t need 5 different OCR vendors. One is fine.

⸻

4. Groq (LLM inference)

Groq should be used only for:
	•	Insight text generation
	•	Budget explanation
	•	Action plans
	•	“Explain this chart” style AI

Do not use it for:
	•	Raw parsing of bank data
	•	Anything requiring deterministic math

⸻

2. Optional / “Later” APIs (not for MVP)

Only after you have one full flow working:
	1.	Email integration
	•	Gmail API / Outlook Graph API
	•	For subscription emails, invoices, etc.
	•	MVP substitute: “forward emails to this special address” and manually parse later.
	2.	Accounting integration (QuickBooks / Xero)
	•	Useful for upsell & stickiness.
	•	Not required for v1.
	•	You can hardcode a “coming soon” block on Integrations.
	3.	Auth provider (if you outgrow Replit Auth)
	•	Auth0 / Clerk / Supabase Auth
	•	Only if Replit Auth starts choking on multi-tenant / roles.

⸻

3. Security / Compliance Layer (not “APIs” but required discipline)

That Comet blob you pasted is basically saying:
	•	Use:
	•	OAuth2
	•	TLS
	•	Encryption at rest
	•	Role-based access
	•	Secret management
	•	Logging

You do not “add APIs” for that. You:
	•	Store keys in environment variables / secrets manager
	•	Never send raw PAN / credentials to Groq
	•	Limit Plaid scopes to transactions / balances
	•	Implement org isolation in your DB
	•	Add basic audit logging (“who accessed which org’s data when”)

That’s architecture, not more vendors.

⸻

4. Reality check: what you’re missing right now

Given what you told me, your missing pieces are not “more APIs,” they’re:
	1.	A real ingestion pipeline
	•	From:
	•	Plaid transactions
	•	CSV upload
	•	PDF → Google Document AI
	•	To:
	•	transactions table in your DB with:
org_id, date, amount, vendor, category, department (optional), is_recurring
	2.	A normalization layer
	•	Vendor normalization (simple mapping dict or table)
	•	Category rules
	•	Subscription detection (recurring vendor + descriptor pattern)
	3.	AI orchestration
	•	A service/function that:
	•	Pulls last 90 days of normalized transactions
	•	Builds a compact JSON summary
	•	Sends that to Groq
	•	Gets back:
	•	insights[]
	•	budget object
	•	action_items[]
	•	Saves all that in your DB
	4.	Demo company
	•	Seed database with:
	•	6 months of fake but realistic Plaid-style transactions
	•	Precomputed insights, budgets, action plans
	•	Demo mode button routes you into that org as a read-only user.

⸻

5. Direct answer to your question

“What other APIs do I need?”

For a serious v1 of BlackTop, this is the list:

Must-have:
	•	Stripe (you have it)
	•	Plaid (you need to add this next)
	•	Google Document AI or similar (for OCR, you basically have this)
	•	Groq (LLM, you have it)

Nice-to-have later:
	•	Gmail / Outlook API (email ingestion)
	•	QuickBooks/Xero (accounting sync)
	•	Better auth (Auth0/Clerk) if Replit Auth becomes a problem

Before you build a deck

You need actual numbers.

Before you talk to investors

You need a coherent financial story.

Before a cap table matters

You need to know:
	•	burn
	•	runway
	•	spend patterns
	•	what to cut
	•	what’s repeatable revenue
	•	whether your business is viable

Before due diligence

You need normalized data, documents, diagnostics.

Before fundraising

You need to know how much to raise and why.

Before scaling

You need to know which parts of your spend are trash.

Nobody serves this layer.
It’s the “pre-CFO, pre-FP&A, pre-founder-enablement” layer.
