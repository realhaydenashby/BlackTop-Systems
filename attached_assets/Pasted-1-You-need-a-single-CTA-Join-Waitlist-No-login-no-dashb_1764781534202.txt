1. You need a single CTA: “Join Waitlist”

No login, no dashboard, no fake “demo.”
Just one CTA everywhere so people can’t wander into an empty house.

This button goes to either:

Option A: an embedded form
Option B: a hosted waitlist page (cleaner, less jank)

Both are fine, but Option B scales better.

2. Use a service that does NOT expose waitlist counts

Do NOT build this from scratch unless you love pain.

Use one of these:

The good choices
	•	Tally.so (best UX, invisible backend, easy embed)
	•	Typedream Waitlist (cleanest for startups, no count)
	•	Webflow form → Zapier → Airtable (more effort, more control)
	•	HubSpot Form free tier (actually good, tracks leads, zero exposure)

Avoid
	•	Product Hunt Ship (public counts, cringe)
	•	Notion forms with public pages (rookie mistake)

All your submissions should feed a private backend:
	•	Airtable
	•	Google Sheets
	•	HubSpot CRM
	•	or your own Postgres

Nobody sees anything except you.

3. What it actually collects

Keep it brutally simple or your conversion rate tanks.

Collect:
	•	Name
	•	Email
	•	Role (dropdown)
	•	Company (optional)
	•	“What problem are you facing right now?” (optional)

That last one becomes gold for your outbound.

4. The UX flow on your site

HERO SECTION
• Big headline
• Sub-headline
• One CTA button: “Get On the Waitlist”

Button → /waitlist page.

⸻

WAITLIST PAGE

Clean, barebones, no extra navigation.
	•	1–2 lines about the product
	•	A tiny value promise
	•	The form
	•	A line saying:
“No spam. You’ll only hear from us when something real is ready.”

Absolutely zero reference to:
	•	Who’s on the list
	•	How many are on the list
	•	Any testimonials (because you don’t have them yet)

⸻

5. How to structure the backend so nobody sees anything

If you use Tally or Webflow
	•	The backend is automatically private.
	•	Export to Airtable or Sheets.
	•	You control 100 percent visibility.

If you want a simple developer-controlled solution

Use:
	•	A /api/waitlist endpoint on Vercel
	•	POST request dumps entries into a private database
	•	Done
Nobody but you can query it.

This is overkill unless you need custom logic.

⸻

6. What you post on LinkedIn
	•	A polished banner
	•	A clean CTA linking to terra-yield.com/waitlist
	•	Nothing else
Do NOT brag about waitlist numbers.
Do NOT show any names (GDPR + professionalism).

Just funnel traffic.

⸻

7. How you use the waitlist later
	•	Sort by role (farmer, banker, co-op, etc.)
	•	Reach out for interviews, pilots, and demos
	•	When you launch:
segment → personalize → convert

It’s not complicated. Just needs discipline.
